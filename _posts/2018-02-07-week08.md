## Week 8 

### Consider the open source projects that you are familiar with (not necesserily the one that you are working on in this class). Could any of them  be classified as humanitarian  or having humanitarian aspect? Explain. 
Yes, I remember some of the projects that we researched during the first few classes when we were trying to get more familiar with open source projects definitelty had a humanitarian aspect to them. There was one project that I remember whose focus was on the goal of making payments easier in local businesses in Africa. This open source project definitely had in mind more humane issues and I think if the goal of the project is a humanitarian goal, that is very easy to tell. 

### Project Progress
Currently in our project we are looking at issues that would be good for us to contribute to. We have found a few easier and harder ones so we have decided to split those up. We keep all of our progress in our progress board for the project on Github.

### Next Step in Project
I will be working on getting more familiar with the Jupyter project and trying to do things with it so I can get more familiar with using it. As well, one of the issues that we have split up I will be working on along with one of the other team members, since it is onf oe the harder issues, so one of our goals is to start looking into that issue.
