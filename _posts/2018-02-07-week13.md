## Last Week of Open Source


I think this was an amazing course and I am so glad to have had the opportunity to take it! It taught me a lot about open source 
development and working on a team. Prior to the course I did not have experience in open source development at all so it was really
great to have the opportunity to learn about it in a hands on way and it was really cool to have an open source project where
we worked on open source material as a team. I think that component of the class really made it an amazing course because we had 
the chance to not only learn but also do, which I feel is super important in CS classes. 

I learned about the history of open source, how it started. how open source works, what type of open source projects exist and a lot more from the course. Some
things I wish we had learned was how do we create open source projects. I think a lot of it was in the perspective of companies
or other people, so it would have been cool to think about it in a way where we were doing the open sourcing. Theres is nothing
I would really remove from the course, because I think everything fit really well together. If I could add one thing,
it would probably be more speakers or an opportunity to go visit a company's office and talk to developers and people there. 


Overall this was a really great class and I really enjoyed it!
