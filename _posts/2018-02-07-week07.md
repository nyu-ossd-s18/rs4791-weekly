## Open Data Week 

### NYC Open Data Week @ NYU
For Open Data Week I attended two events, the first being the Open Data Week at NYU featuring the BUGS club. 

What was discussed: For this event, there was a panel with three people who worked with open source projects in their full-time roles and they discussed a variety of topics around open source data, such as how they got into open source data and projects that they have worked on. They also opened up the panel to questions from the audience. 

What I learned: I leanred a lot about the basics of open source data and how much really goes into the implications of using open source data. I learned a lot about the process of making open source data to people and how to start to work with open source data. I learned that open source data is very powerful and the information that we can get from open source data is very great. 

What I liked/disliked: I really liked the fact that we got to hear very three distinct and different perspectives on open source data and I liked that althuogh they all worked with open source data. they all did very different things within open source and so what they all had to say was very different and I really enjoyed that aspect of the panel.

### Data Through Design Art Exhibit: 
For the second event I attended the Data Through Design Art Exhibit in the NY Media Center.

What I learned: I really enjoyed this art exhibit because it gave me the chance to explore everyone's project and see how data can be displayed in a variety of ways. Each project was very different in the type of information that it was displaying as well what the message was.

What I liked/disliked: I really liked the fact that I was able to see how data can be represented in different ways. I realized that they really displayed the data in different ways such as lights, tectures, fabrics and even videos. Each project also displayed where they got the data from, which was all open source data. I think through the art exhibits, I was also bale to get a different perspective and idea about the data by being able to seee if physiclaly and being able to see it displayed in an interesting way.
