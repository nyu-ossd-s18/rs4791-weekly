## Week 11

### Team Project Progress
As a team, we are pretty far along in working on with Jupyter Notebook and fixing issues. 
We have gotten a pretty solid understanding of how to contribute to the project and how to pick out issues 
that we can work on together. We have each worked on a few issues together and it has been a pretty cool experience 
being able to contribute to this project and learning more about what it means to work on open source projects.
We have worked on a range of projects from error messaging to documentation.
