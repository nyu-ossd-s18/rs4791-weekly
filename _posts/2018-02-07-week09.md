## Week 9

### Questions for Danna
1. What sparked your interest in open source projects?
2. After having worked with open source projects for a while, what have you learned so far.
3. How do you think open source projects could help us tackle today's problems. 

### Project Progress
Currently in our project we are tackling some issues that we have selected. Celina and I decided to work on one of the issues together and our first step was to try to re-create the issue. We were having some problems re-creating the issue but we were able to re-create it by blocking the cookies from a certain local host and then starting up the program. We are also looking into issues that we can work as a grup on. 


### Contributions
So far, I have not contributed to anything but this week I am planning to look into more of what I should contribute on.
