## Week 10 


### Reflection on Danna's Talk 
I really enjoyed Danna's talk this week. It was really interesting learning more about the open source projects at Google and how they use these tools in their development process. It was also really interesting to learn more about how the open source tools are used and how contrubutions from people outside of Google are incorporated into the project. She also talked about how we as students can contribute to Google open source software. I really enjoyed the talk and I feel like I did learn a lot. 

### Project Progress 
As a team we are wrapping up some issues that we were working on individually and as pairs and now we are looking for issues that we can work on together. We are trying to work on things together because we haven't really gotten the chance to workl on things together so we are really trying to do that.
