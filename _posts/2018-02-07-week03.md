### Contributing to a Wikipedia Page
This was my first time editing a Wikipedia Page. I made an account and I decided to edit the page of one of the members of one of my favorite music groups, Migos. My favorite member is Offset. I decided to edit the part of the article that talked more about his engagement with Cardi B. It recently happened and there wasn't much information on there about the engagement so I thought it would be an opportunity to provide more information on it. So I added in more information about the type of ring that he proposed with which I thught was interesting information.
