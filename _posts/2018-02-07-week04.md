### Code Triage 
This is my first time having an account on Code Triage. I actually did not know what it was until we were assigned this homework assignment to look into it. I think it is a very cool place to look at open source projects that people are working on and it is kind of like a great place for people to start off, especially as a beginner to open source projects. It was cool to see projects that I knew such as atom and elastic search which I use / have used. I think it is really awesome to think that you can contribute to projects that you use on a daily basis and make a change in some way. Those were also the two projects that I signed up for and I am looking forward to working on them.
