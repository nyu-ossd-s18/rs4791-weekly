Hi!
My name is Rosa and I am a senior at NYU majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Web Programming & Applications. I am originally from Georgia. My interests in technology include front-end development and web design. I am excited about taking this Open Source Development course because I have never contribued to open source projects and I think this will be a great opportunity to learn more and contribute to some projects that I am interested in!
